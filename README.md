# Trinity Carpool
### A carpool management app designed and created by the students of Austin's Trinity Episcopal School. 
-------------------------------------
<br>Create an app that helps carpool run faster, smoother, and more efficiently. 
This is so that we get longer recess.<br>
-------------------------------------
_**The checkout System...**_<br>
is designed to get kids out of the carpool room *as quickly and effeciently as possible.* <br>
For example, if two kids are carpooling together, and are not related, the parent
picking them up would say the names of the kids being picked up.<br>
Then, the kids will get a notification, and go outside.<br>
After the parent has the kids, the app will let you check out.
Once you have checked out, The teachers will know you have left. <br>
--------------------------------------
**This application should cover the following aspects...** <br>
  1. A volume notification for a loud classroom <br>
  2. A notification to load in at a particular time to tell parents when they need to leave <br>
  3. Media (Video/Music) integration to keep kids quiet <br>
  4. Status Information retrieval to tell kids where their parents are <br>
  5. "Pre" notifications that let you know when someone has arrived and will be looking for you <br>
  6. Displaying student names, grades <br>
  7. It vibrates when they need to be notified, for instance, when their parents have arrived <br>
  8. ATB notifications (When they need to go, if they are waiting for their parents, etc.) <br>
